## Steve Ivy

Hello! 👋 

I am a senior software engineer in the Phoenix, Arizona metro area, with over 20 years of experience in building and maintaining full-stack web applications, APIs and complex data systems that prioritize user experience, efficiency, and the needs of the organization at every level.

I specialize in Python web applications, REST API design, backend systems, data pipelines and databases, with a focus on creating efficient, maintainable, and innovative solutions for market research, financial, and technology companies.

I'm an advocate for respecting users (internal or external), open standards and tools, developer experience and creating and maintaining transparency technically and organizationally.

If you're hiring, see my [resume](https://monkinetic.blog/resume) and [drop me a note](mailto:steveivy@gmail.com?subject=Hiring). :)

### Code

I don't do much on Github (surprise), my personal code is largely at [Gitlab/steveivy](https://gitlab.com/steveivy).
